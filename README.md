# ArduinCar

Repository for my first robotics project, here we command a robot car using voice.

We built an agentic system using LangGraph, we have tools to order car to go backward or forward. This agent receives textual data from streamlit input, or alternativetly from voice speech that we recognize and input as text. Both ways are sent to agent and he recognizes wich tool we need to call.

This repository will have 3 projects:\n
  1- Connect Arduin on mac via USB and connect agent to turn on or off LED's based on user intent.
  2- Make project 1 but using Bluetooth connection, instead of USB.
  3- Use knowledge from project 2 to build a car that is guided by voice/commands that are sent to agent.
